              Hidden Markov Models (HMM) are stochastic methods to model temporal and sequence
              data. They are especially known for their application in temporal pattern recognition
              such as speech, handwriting, gesture recognition, part-of-speech tagging, musical
              score following, partial discharges and bioinformatics.</para>

              Dynamical systems of discrete nature assumed to be governed by a Markov chain emits
              a sequence of observable outputs. Under the Markov assumption, it is also assumed that
              the latest output depends only on the current state of the system. Such states are often
              not known from the observer when only the output values are observable.</para>

              it should be.</para>

              Learning problem. Given some training observation sequences O = {o1, o2, ..., oK}

            <param name="iterations">
              The maximum number of iterations to be performed by the learning algorithm. If
              specified as zero, the algorithm will learn until convergence of the model average
              likelihood respecting the desired limit.

            <param name="observations">
              An array of observation sequences to be used to train the model.
            </param>
            <param name="tolerance">
              The likelihood convergence limit L between two iterations of the algorithm. The
              algorithm will stop when the change in the likelihood for two consecutive iterations
              has not changed by more than L percent of the likelihood. If left as zero, the
              algorithm will ignore this parameter and iterates over a number of fixed iterations

              The average log-likelihood for the observations after the model has been trained.
